# Giant Extension Ladders
> **This is a Harmony-Mod for the game Lethal Company**

**This mod adds a few new Extension Ladders of different sizes to the store that are better than the lame normal ones!**\
Ever got stuck on a ladder because it was just not high enough? Well, with up to **SEVEN times the normal ladder size**, these ladders won't let you down!

**Don't like climbing? But I bet you like murder!** \
No one expects a deadly ladder from above that was placed far away!

ðŸŸ¦&nbsp; Big Extension Ladder \
ðŸŸ§&nbsp; Huge Extension Ladder \
ðŸŸ¥&nbsp; Ultimate Extension Ladder

## Features
> I recommend using an additional mod for faster climbing (I made this one ([Fast Climbing](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Inoyu/Fast_Climbing/)), but there are plenty of other mods that'll work too).
- Beeg ladder for climbing higher than usual
- Huge ladder for climbing even higher
- Ultimate ladder for climbing **EVEN** higher
- Tiny ladder to play with ..it could be lethal tho!

## Configs (synced with lobby-host configs!)
__The config file is located in "BepInEx\config\GiantExtensionLadders.cfg"__
- set ladder prices
- set the time the ladder remains extended (values above 660 last longer than a whole day!)
- specific ladders can be enabled/disabled

## Future Updates & what I'm working on
- more ladders! _(maybe)_
- bug fixes etc. _sigh_
- fixing ladder collision with terrain

## Known Issues
> **If [CSync](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sigurd/CSync/) is not installed, settings won't be synced with host!**
 - There is a bit of space between the objects and the ladder
 - Roof Collision does not work yet (ladders will often go through the wall, if activated in the ship/facility)
 - **Many of the problems/bugs that the normal ladder has** too, that includes:
   - Ground collision is too sensitive on uneven ground, so the ladder will stop at an angle above the ground (more visible the longer the ladder is)

_If you encounter other bugs, feel free to report them on the Issues page or write me directly via Discord (inoyuuuuu)._

## Installation
 > **I highly recommend using ebkr's modmanager [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) for easy mod installation and ensuring that everyone has the same mods and configs!**

This mod requires three other mods! \
