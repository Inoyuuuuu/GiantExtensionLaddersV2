# Giant Extension Ladders 
_Works with update v50 of the game!_ 

This mod adds a few new Extension Ladders of different sizes to the store that are better than the lame normal ones! Ever got stuck on your way to the fire exit because your ladder was just not high enough? Well, with up to **SEVEN times the normal ladder size** this won't happen again!

**Don't like climbing? But I bet you like murder!** \
No one expects a deadly ladder from above that was placed far away!

## Features
> You can use an additional mod for faster climbing (I made this one ([Fast Climbing](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Inoyu/Fast_Climbing/)), but there are plenty of other mods that'll work too).
- **NEW: The Tiny ladder is now usable if the player is tiny too!** \
For this you'll need mods that can shrink players to 0.25 and lower of their size (tested on [LittleCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Toybox/LittleCompany/)).
- Big ladder for climbing higher than usual
- Huge ladder for climbing even higher
- Ultimate ladder for climbing **EVEN** higher
- Tiny ladder to play with  _...could be deadly!_

## How do they look in game?
You can look at the pictures on the [thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Inoyu/Giant_Extension_Ladders/) if you're interested. c:

## Configs (synced with lobby-host's configs!)
- set ladder prices
- set the time the ladder remains extended
- set ladders to "always active", so they'll stay extended indefinitely
- enable/disable specific ladders
- set the method used for a bugfix regarding a small bug with sales
     - safe fix: (enable this to avoid any kind of issues)
     - Experimental fix (enable this if you're not afraid of any potential bugs/issues)
     - don't fix (enable this if you don't care about some sales sometimes being falsely displayed)

## Future Updates?
At the moment there are no planned updates, but if you have any cool ideas/suggestions feel free to write me on Discord either directly (inoyuuuuu) or on the [LethalCompany Modding server](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC) in this mod's thread!

## Known Issues
_If you have questions or encounter any bugs, feel free to report them on the [GitHub issue-page](https://github.com/Inoyuuuuu/GiantExtensionLaddersV2/issues) or write me directly via Discord (inoyuuuuu)!_
 - Ladders are sometimes not in complete sync, meaning they can be extended for one player but not for others
 - On rare occasions a ladder might not tip over, placing it again should help
 - While the ladder stops at the roof, the ladder's collision continues above it (will fix)
 - Climbing on the tiny ladder exits early when climbing a more horizontal ladder
 - **Some of the problems/bugs that the normal ladder has** too, that includes:
   - Ground collision is too sensitive on uneven ground, so the ladder will stop at an angle above the ground (more visible the longer the ladder is)
   - **New in v50:** you sometimes can't climb down ladders completely, you'll have to let go of the ladder manually (pressing E)

## Installation
 > **I highly recommend using ebkr's modmanager [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) for easy mod installation and ensuring that everyone has the same mods and configs!**
