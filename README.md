# Giant Extension Ladders
> **This is a Harmony-Mod for the game Lethal Company**

**This mod adds new huge Extension Ladders to the store that are way bigger than the lame normal ones!**\
Ever got stuck on a ladder because it was just not high enough? Well, with almost **twice and even FOUR times** the normal ladder size, these ladders won't let you down!

**Don't like climbing? But I bet you like murder!** \
No one expects a deadly ladder from above that was placed far away!

## Features
> I like using another mod that allows faster climbing. I made one ([Fast Climbing](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Inoyu/Fast_Climbing/)), but there are a couple of other mods that'll work too.
- Beeg ladder for climbing higer than usual
- Huge ladder for climbing even higher
- Tiny ladder to play with - it could be lethal tho!

## Configs (now synced with lobby-host configs!)
__The config file is located in "BepInEx\config\inoyu.GiantExtensionLadders.cfg"__
- Ladder prices
- The time the ladder remains extended
- If a specific ladder is enabled/disabled

## Future Updates
- More ladders! _(maybe)_
- code cleanup _sigh_

## Known Issues
> **Update 1.3.0 requires you to have version 2.1.0 of [CSync](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Owen3H/CSync/) installed!**
 - There is a bit of space between the objects and the ladder
 - Roof Collision does not work yet (ladders will often go through the wall, if activated in the ship/facility)
 - **Many of the problems/bugs that the normal ladder has** too, that includes:
   - Ground collision is too sensitive on uneven ground, so the ladder will stop at an angle above the ground (more visible the longer the ladder is)
   - If pressing climb on an extended ladder from the backside (or while falling), the player will climb in the air. **So, when using a ladder, you want to start climbing from bottom!**
   - Can sometimes fall a bit into an object - try placing the ladder again

_If you encounter other bugs, feel free to report them on the GitHub page or write me directly via Discord (inoyuuuuu)._

## Installation
 > **I highly recommend using [r2modman's modmanager](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)**
